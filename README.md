# Which Is The Format?
volumes.geojson:
  - Here volumes are included to later use them as sectors. To pass the vatglasses data into the required form, it is possible by using this converter: [VATGLASSES-CDM-CONVERTER](https://cdm.vatsimspain.es/vatglasses-to-cdm)
  - MinFL, MaxFL and capacity are a must to have correctly defined airspaces.
  - Lateral limits should be defined as Multipolygon (Like Vatspy data).
  - To check data by vertical limits, the following website is created (Data from the main branch is used): [AIRSPACES-MAP](https://cdm.vatsimspain.es/airspaces-map.html)
  - ID must be UPPERCASE and must include the first two letter of the FIR. Example for Spain: "LE-airblockName".

procedures.txt
  - Format ``<AIRPORT>:SID:<letters or procedures name>:STAR:<letters or procedures name>`` example: ``LEBL:SID:SENIA%Q,LARPA%Q,T:STAR:BISBA%W,LESBA%W,Z,Q``
    - AIRPORT: ICAO code.
    - letters: last letter of SID/STAR, set all the valid letters. Empty if all are valid.
    - (OPTIONAL) Runway or config designator can be added at the end of each procedure (Example: P/25,SPESA%C/WEST,SPESA%C/TEST, etc.) - Note: If designator is selected in the Dashboard Data maintenance, the system will only look for the procedures for the specified runway.
  - The decision of which procedure to choose will be:
    - If pilot filed SID/STAR is in the valid list, then it will selected.
    - If pilot does not file a SID/STAR, the first in the list is chosen (order is by given in letters).
  - If any can be selected, then direct path will be created.

profile_restrictions.txt (NOT USED ANYMORE. Maintenance or PTR in vIFF Dashboard)
  - Format ``<ICAO_DEP>:<ICAO_DEST>:<WPT>:<FL>`` example: ``LPPT,LPFR:*:IMOBA:200`` or ``*:EDDM:SUNIS/lat,lon/LIMRA:200``
  - ICAO_DEP: dep airport (or list of airports "," seperated), "*" to select all dep airports (Ex. LPPT,LPCS).
  - ICAO_DEST: dest airport (or list of airports "," seperated), "*" to select all dest airports (Ex. LEBL).
  - WPT: Waypoint to be level at.
     - Decimal coordinates can be used and including the point to be included in route for the condition to be valid. Format: **WPTbefore/lat,lon/WPTafter** or **WPTbefore/lat,lon** or **lat,lon/WPTafter** Example: ``SUNIS/47.6676,14.8851/MORED`` or ``SUNIS/47.6676,14.8851`` or ``47.6676,14.8851/MORED``.
     - Multiple can be included ``|`` seperated: Example: ``SUNIS/47.6676,14.8851/LIMRA|LIMRA/47.70,14.90/XANEX`` or ``AKINI|TURBU|XOMBA`` or mixed ``ALOSO/50.3533,11.5725|BAMKI/50.3725,11.2288|UNAVI|RELKO/50.3533,11.5725``.
     - FL: numeric value indicating the FL (Ex. 200).

  Remark: it will only be respected, if RFL is at or above.
  Remark: This will override SID/STAR ALT restrictions.
